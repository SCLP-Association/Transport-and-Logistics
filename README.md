## Dependencies
To run the project, you will need to install Node.js and React using npm, the Node.js package manager.

## Installation and Usage
To install the dependencies, run npm install. Once the dependencies are installed, run npm start to start the development server. You can then access the website at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

## Challenges Faced
Throughout the development process, I faced certain challenges related to the website's design. One of the issues was that the initial width of the design provided in the Figma link was too large, making it challenging to adjust the white space to fit my screen appropriately. Additionally, styling the components using CSS posed another challenge, as I needed to ensure that my styles did not conflict with existing styles from other components or elements. It required careful attention to avoid unintended conflicts and maintain consistency in the overall design.
